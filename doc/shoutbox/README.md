### RESTful API build
The idea of REST is that application data can be queried and changed using verbs and nouns,
represented HTTP methods and URLs, respectively. A REST request will typically return data
in a machine-readable form, such as JSON or XML.

To implement an API, we'll do the following:
- Design an API that allows users to show, list, remove, and post entries
- Add Basic authentication
- Implement routing
- Provide JSON and XML responses
